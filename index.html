       <h1 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;"> Hello, I am Berry</h1>
       <br>
       <h2 style="color:Tomato;"About me. </h2>
       <p style="color:Tomato;"I am 16 years old. My birthday is October 25th. I am in 11th grade, and I go to Colton-Pierrepont Central School. </p>
       <p style="color:Tomato;"I have a few hobbies, like playing ULTRAKILL, Coding, drawing, animating. I draw for the object show community, and I animate memes using object show charaters as well. I have just started coding, but I believe that coding is something I would like to contine doing in my life.</p>
       <p style="color:Tomato;" I am a huge family and friend person, as I hold them dear to me. I have a handful of friends, but you can find me almost always chatting one up when I am home.</p>
       <h2 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;" Flower. </h2>
<p style="color:Tomato;"Flower is my pet cat, she is 13 years old, and her birthday is on Thanksgiving every year. Flower is a tortoiseshell. </p>
<p style="color:Tomato;"I first got Flower when I was four, having rescued her from a barn, taking her in shortly after as my own cat. Flower has lived with me for the majority of my life, and has always lived in the same house as me once we've got her.</p>

    <h2>Moving.</h2>
<p style="color:Tomato;"When I was born I lived in Iowa with my mom and my father. Once I became three and a half we ended up moving in with my mom's parents, who lived here in New York in a small town called Massena. We lived there for a while until I was around 9 years old, when me and my mom got an apartment out in Potsdam. Me, my mom, and Flower, lived together for a few years until my mom went to college. While in college my mom met Christina. Christina and my mom started to date, and now I live in an old church in Colton with me, my mom, Flower, and Christina.</p>
<p style="color:Tomato;"I haven't really minded moving before in the past, but I feel comfortable where I am now, as I am no longer homeschooled and I have friends that live in this community.</p>
    <h2>School.</h2>
    <p style="color:Tomato;"I never went to school in Iowa, but once I moved here to New York I went to Massena's kindergarten and eventually elementary School. I had just started Middle School when covid broke out, causing everyone to need to do online learning. Online learning had failed me as a student, as I am really hands on and I need to be in a classroom to work as efficiently as I need to. Because of this, me and my mom had decided to do homeschooling, as my mom had a teaching degree. For three years, I was homeschooled, only really going to school to do state tests to prove that I had actually learned what I had to learn. In 2023, I started 10th grade in Colton-Pierrepont Central School. I am now in 11th grade, and currently going to school at Colton, as well as doing BOCES.</p>
